# NUS-Summer-Workshop

The repository for the 2024 NUS Summer Workshop (SWS3002) includes several key components to aid in the analysis and presentation of your simulation project. Here's a brief overview of each component:

1. **`input & OA.ipynb`**:
   This Jupyter notebook is used to import data, perform output analysis, and conduct hypothesis testing. Ensure that all necessary libraries and datasets are correctly referenced and that your analysis is thorough and well-documented.

2. **`draw.ipynb`**:
   This notebook is designated for creating important visualizations for your presentation. Make sure the plots and graphs are clear, well-labeled, and effectively communicate your findings.

3. **`NUS Summer Workshop.pptx`**:
   This PowerPoint presentation is intended for the final report and presentation. Ensure that it is comprehensive, visually appealing, and aligned with the content from your analysis and simulations.

4. **`Model for Presenting.doe`**:
   This is your Arena simulation model file. It should be checked and debugged thoroughly. Ensure that it runs correctly and that the results are consistent with your analysis and presentation.
